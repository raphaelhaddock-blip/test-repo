# GitHub MCP Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my learning journey with GitHub and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with Claude.

## What I Built

### 1. **Calculator Module** (`calculator.py`)
A Python module with mathematical functions:
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Power (exponentiation)
- Complete test suite (`test_calculator.py`)

### 2. **Flask Web Application** (`web_app/`)
A full-stack web calculator with:
- **Backend**: Flask API with RESTful endpoints
- **Frontend**: Modern gradient UI with responsive design
- **Architecture**: MVC pattern with templates and static files
- **Features**: Real-time calculations, error handling

## What I Learned

### GitHub Workflow Mastery
✅ **Repository Management**
- Creating and initializing repositories
- Managing files and directories
- Understanding project structure

✅ **Version Control**
- Creating branches for feature development
- Making commits with meaningful messages
- Merging changes back to main

✅ **Collaboration Tools**
- Creating and managing Issues
- Building Pull Requests with detailed descriptions
- Code review process
- Linking PRs to Issues

✅ **Code Discovery**
- Searching GitHub for repositories
- Finding code examples and patterns
- Learning from popular projects

### Technical Skills

**Python Development**
- Writing clean, documented code
- Creating unit tests
- Organizing code into modules

**Web Development**
- Flask framework basics
- RESTful API design
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript integration
- Modern UI/UX patterns

**Professional Practices**
- README documentation
- Requirements management
- Git workflow (branch → PR → merge)
- Issue tracking

## GitHub MCP Integration

This entire project was built using Claude with GitHub MCP integration, demonstrating:
- Automated repository management
- Programmatic file creation and updates
- Issue and PR automation
- Code search capabilities

## Project Structure

```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Automation is Powerful**: GitHub MCP lets you automate entire development workflows through conversation
2. **Proper Structure Matters**: Well-organized projects are easier to maintain and collaborate on
3. **Documentation is Essential**: Good READMEs and comments make code accessible
4. **Testing is Crucial**: Unit tests ensure code reliability
5. **Version Control is Freedom**: Branches let you experiment without breaking production code

## Next Steps

Potential areas to explore:
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Collaborative development with multiple contributors
- Advanced Git operations (rebasing, cherry-picking)
- Open source contribution
- Building more complex applications
